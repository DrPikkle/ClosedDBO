# CLOSE DBO PROJECT
 Under Development by **Core Interactive Games - (CIGS)**
A Small Scale Game Development Studio. (very Small Scale)
we had to switch to discord because our own messaging app got dropped and shutdown soo many links were lost.... sigh...

## CIGS:
We're a group of no lifers dedicated to DBO Development we've been working on a more 3D Version of DBO since 2018 
however the project was too big and lenghty so because of that we lost alot of devs and had to drop the project, 
so as the Head & Founder we decided to go with DBO 2.0 the Next Best thing.

## Goals
- Graphical Advancements
- Performance Optimizing
- Post Level Cap Content & More...

## Next Big Patch (Editing After March 31st)
- v2.80.0 - March 31, 2026
